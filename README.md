# Master-Thesis

The repository contains the source code of my master's thesis "End-to-end optimisation of MIMO systems using autoencoder based on the deep learning". It is a learning algorithm which generates a MIMO transmitter and receiver realisation simultenously. This includes digital modulation and mimo encoding. The MIMO channel is modelled as a MIMO-Rayleigh-Block-Fading-Channel. For further inquieries or questions just contact me.

## Getting Started

First make sure CUDA Toolkit is installed to use GPU resources.

Most important Python Packages needed:
* numpy
* matplotlib
* tensorflow
* pickle
* cudNN

## Acknowledgments

* Thank you Felix Wunsch and Dr. Holger Jaekel for guiding me through the thesis
* Source code is based on Dr.-Ing. Jakob Hoydis' realisation of the autoencoder model from the paper "An Introduction to Deep Learning for the Physical Layer" (Timothy O’Shea; Jakob Hoydis, 02 October 2017)
